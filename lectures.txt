[CGL notes that these are notes from Batley (probably) or else perhaps Mark.]

Lecture 1:
==========
o Introduction : finished introduction - basically OK perhaps add diagrams
                 for u,s,t 
  Rates        : to bottom of page 22. Improve discussion of Delta function 
                 Add 4pi p^2 shell but basically OK
Lecture 2: 
========== 
o Rates : good upto end of decays. 
          Cross-section stuff rushed, cross-section picture va+vb took too
          long.  
          p.35 confusing 
          Didn't have time to go through p.36/37
Lecture 3: 
========== 
o Dirac : started 10 minutes late due to data projector  problems
          Upto 65. no real problems although a few typos. 
Lecture 4: 
========== 
o Dirac : finsihed in just about right amount of time. C and P not 100 %
          clear, otherwise pretty good.

Lecture 5: 
========== 
o Particle Exchange : Just right - timing perfect.


Lecture 6: 
========== 
o Electron-Positron : Just right (upto p.135), examples on board worked well:
                           writing down ME
                           evaluation of psi gamma^1 phi

Lecture 7: 
========== 
o Electron-Positron/E-P : Just right (upto p.156).
                            Good place to end but Rutherford was a bit
                                rushed and needs beefing up in handouts.

Lecture 8: 
========== 
o E-P/DIS : Pretty good - took structure functions/form factors nice and
                           slowly (upto p.173). Could have improved
                           Mott "derivation" - connect to early currents (c) 
                           and (s)


Lecture 9: 
========== 
o E-P/DIS : Pretty good - few suggested improvements noted on handouts.
                          Ended at 188 a few minutes early - could expand
                          some material.


Lecture 10:
========== 
o DIS/Quark: DIS went well as did first slides on symmetries. Finished
             to bottom p.206

Lecture 11:
========== 
o Quark: to bottom p.228. OK - a bit dull... need more careful explanation
           when introducing SU(3) - could be better organised

Lecture 12:
========== 
o Quark/QCD to page 251. First 10 minutes without data projector !
                         Basically pretty good. Need to restructure 
                         slightly + DO EXAMPLE OF qxq ON BOARD

Lecture 13:
========== 
o QCD to page 271. Dull ! Colour factors OK - but rest a little flat
              
Lecture 14:
========== 
o QCD/V-A to page 288. QCD OK, rho stuff a bit superfluous. V-A pretty
                       good apart from parity. Need to better explain
                       parity violation in Co decay. 

Lecture 15:
========== 
o V-A/Weak Lept to page 306. 0900 lecture - didn't read through thouroughly
                             enough. V-A good. Leptonic weak - muon decay
                             dull...

Lecture 16:
========== 
o Weak Lept to page 326.     Off to Valencia - can't remember how this went.


Lecture 17:
========== 
o Weak Lept/Nu Osc to page 350. End of Weak a bit rushed + could be better
                                  explained. Nu Osc went well.

Lecture 18:
========== 
o Nu Osc from page 350-369. Not too bad - derivations could be handled better.
                            SuperK atmos - need to mention resolution more
                            explicitely + MUST SHOW L vs CosTheta



Lecture 19: Neutrinos            : Thurs 16th 
o Nu Osc from page 370. Finished 5 minutes early ! Pretty good. A bit
                            repetetive.

Lecture 20: CKM/CP               : Sat   18th
                to end of 414. Went pretty well - CP stuff good. CKM a bit dull
         
Lecture 21: CP                   : Tues  21st
               to end. Good but too rushed. Need to be clearer about 
               relation between neutral kaon states from the outset.
               Also need to better explain how data plots indication
               CP/Dm etc.               

Lecture 22: EW/W                 : Thurs 23th 
               Not bad. W worked reasonably. Gauge worked well. EW unification
                 needs to be made clearer. Skimmed through Z decays. Next
                 year move Z decay to start of lecture 23. 

Lecture 23: Z                    : Sat   25th
               Not bad. Got to start of ALR. Introduce connection to
               sin^2\theta before launching into AFB? Think about
               showing determinations of couplind...    

Lecture 24: Z+H                  : Tues  28th
