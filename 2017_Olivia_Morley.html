<h2>Understanding Particle Physics</h2>
<h3> Olivia Morley<h3>

<pre>Learning of physics, a noble pursuit
Yet with particles, much confusion lies
With negative energies in disguise
Dirac gave solutions, none will dispute
To his theory, this author does salute
However detailed understanding flies
I can hardly profess to be as wise
Is it my fate to become destitute?

In distress to other courses I flee
Hoping to gain insight, to find the truth
In TQM I may be triumphant
Perhaps it will be safer in QFT
Is this only optimism of youth?
I should have just become a consultant</pre>
