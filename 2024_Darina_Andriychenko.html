A Part III&apos;s Plea
</h3>
<pre>
Alas, we see the lecture clock strike one,
And visions fade of quarks so tightly tied 
By hundred human weights they&apos;d not divide.
The lecturer reminds us &mdash; we&apos;re not done! 
 
There still remains a final task (for fun),
An octet and a sextet to provide, 
Or else his poor mood bids him to decide
Part III exams to be a gruelling run. 
 
I seek to right this wrong, and thus present
A plea to make it easy just this once. 
Have us draw superman signs, wiggly charts,
Follow the Piccadilly line&apos;s descent.
Ignore neutrino mixing, spend these months 
Relaxed till Cambridge our degree imparts.
