<H3>Ode to Experimental Particle Physics</h3>
<pre>The time that runs away cannot be saved,
As days tick by our lives refuse to wait,
Our tiny Earth keeps turning round, and fate,
It seems will choose the path that&apos;s to be paved.
But knowledge of the truth is surely craved,
A framework based in maths we do create,
Its elegance revealed but all too late,
Our universal theory can&apos;t be saved.
 
Whilst blackboards might not hold the final key,
The beauty of experiment is clear,
A beam of particles we strive to see,
A measurement to five sigma we cheer,
With time no longer wasted we&apos;re set free,
True meaning found through searches we hold dear.
