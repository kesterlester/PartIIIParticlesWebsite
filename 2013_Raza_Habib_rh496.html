I dream to see inside my lecturer’s head.
For Particle Physics is not designed,
to give an undergraduate great peace of mind.
If I only knew what he thought and read,
the fear of Tripos would be banishèd.
No longer would I have to wait to find,
Why quarks and gluons are allowed to bind.
At last after all these years, I’d finally be ahead!

On second thought, I’m not sure I am prepared,
To see what lies beneath the physicists floppy mane.
Some thoughts are best not aired.
In the dark recesses of his brain,
What will I find that cant be shared?
And will I suffer pain?
