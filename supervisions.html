We plan to have four students per supervision, but can accommodate two groups at the same time in some timeslots, so no more than 8 people will be allocated a timeslot.

The first supervisions will take place in the week starting Monday 27th of October. NOTE: although this poll has specific dates, this will be your supervision time for the rest of the term. Please sign with your FIRST NAME - FAMILY NAME - (CRSid), for example Jane Doe (jd123).

15 slots are offered, but they will be shaken down to 14 or fewer.
