Wisdom is Meaningless
</h3>
<pre>&ldquo;Meaningless! Meaningless!&rdquo; thought the student,
musing through thoughts on chirality
and losing the grip on their sanity.
Why not take the chance to be a truant,
and avoid all this which is quite impudent.
For what became of the helicity?
Why in all of its quaint simplicity
it's sadly not Lorentz invariant!

Slides strectch out across the board forever.	
The teacher, in jest, steered to distract,
producing this one remarkable fact,
that even Dirac, for all his renown,		
could not avoid the common student err.	
Indeed he'd forgotten to take his gown.

<h4>Programme notes</h4>
The author writes:
An attempt was made to stick to iambic pentameter (atleast in some parts), certainly this gave me a better appreciation of the talent of the likes of Milton. Hopefully the title is not too despairing, I drew inspiration for it (and the opening line) from the opening to the Book of Ecclsiastes.
