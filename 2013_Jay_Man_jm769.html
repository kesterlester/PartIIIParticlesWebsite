I would that you my humble sonnet keep
Under your bonnet, such that I might turn
It into Oriel, for the chance to reap
Riches untold! The pounds that I (won't) earn
Will make a shallow dent in my huge debt...
(Feel free to post the limerick vignette)

There once was a lecturer named Chris
Who set work for I, physicist
But my work is so dire
I set it on fire
And turned in as recompense this.
