To begin man marveled under pretense,
four elements to make all the matter. 
Dispelled by chemists, mad as a hatter.
"Invariant World" cried Hendrik Lorentz, 
singular field theories caused much offense.
To make sense of it one tries to scatter,
particles off of all types of matter. 
A wealth of knowledge found despite
defense. 

Three lessons to find such as the muon. 
Particles exchanged to bind the proton.
Each person hit by solar neutrino.
Colour QCD bound by the gluon. 
To end, slow man wept seeing the photon.
Finally, to quote Feynman "shmoonino".
