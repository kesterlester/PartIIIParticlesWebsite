<pre>In the world of the very small,

Where quarks and leptons dance around,

The rules of physics seem to change.

In this strange and wonderful place,

The mysteries of the Universe abound.

Particle physics is the study of these things.

It's a quest to understand whats going on,

And to find out how it all works.

To unlock the secrets of the very small.

It's a fascinating field of study,

For those who want to know more about

The nature of reality itself.

So if you're curious about the cosmos,

And want to understand its inner workings,

Then particle physics is the place for you
