<H3>Alice's Adventures in Collider-land</h3>
<pre>
Within lies hidden cryptic beauty cloaked,
In simple stories cast in readers' minds.
Aboard the ship true North the compass finds,
With scenes of jade and opal hills evoked.
In lucid dreams where fantasies are stoked,
Trapped Alice wanders on and there she finds,   
Clear cloudless skies with stars and comets lined,
Her quest complete the opera's scene uncloaked.
 
The harp and cello start, an organ sounds,    
Rare beauty based in miracles hidden deep.
Athena beckons Zeus and hope resounds,
Cascades of silver shine at Hera's feet.
Eased gently awake edelweiss surrounds,
Rich memories which whispered secrets keep.

<h3>Commentary</h3>
<p>
Within this Petrarchan sonnet, inspired by Lewis Carroll's "Alice's Adventures in Wonderland", the reader is taken on a journey through past, present, and future particle physics experiments/detectors. As Alice tumbles down one of the access shafts to the Large Hadron Collider at CERN, a swirling world of chaos, beauty and nonsense opens us around her hiding the experiments aiming to answer some of the most fundamental questions about our Universe. But here they have been transformed into dizzying kaleidoscopic images of scenes their names evoke. Overall, 31 of these experiments/detectors lie hidden within the sonnet as given in the list below which includes a relevant paper/technical report and webpage for each where possible.
