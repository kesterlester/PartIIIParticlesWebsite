<H3>Vigil of the Distant Stars</h3>
<pre>Ophiuchus, the serpent bearer glares
Accusingly, and back looked men in vain
So earnestly trying to ascertain
What hidden forces governed their affairs
The titans of the sky, observed by heirs
Exact their might, an effort to obtain
Though strong with size, the weakest when mundane
A hidden realm is reigning, and declares

Our motion, battle of opposing sides
Integrity of self, a tighter bond requires
Colours combine, sum greater than their parts
Our history, a 'weakness' helps confide
The stars bear witness, man will never tire
A dream to learn entrenched within all hearts

<h4>Programme Notes</h4>
The author writes: &ldquo;Hopefully I&apos;ve made it obvious that this is about the fundamental forces. Line 9 references the electric signals that govern muscle contractions. The slightly more obscure description in the 12th line is a reference to radiocarbon dating and the role of mutation in evolution.&rdquo;
