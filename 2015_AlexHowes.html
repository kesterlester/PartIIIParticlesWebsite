Behold the lowly physicist! You thought
you'd found the standard model symmetry
and called it truth. But tests do not agree,
and leave you with a piece of physics wrought
with holes. This cause for which your fathers fought
is naught but gaps in which dark energy
and three neutrino masses stubbornly
refuse to fit. And so you sit, distraught.

But wait, dear physicist, do not despair
whilst there's amusement to be found in strings.
And twistors, SUSY, loops and causal set
maps too, or join the hunt to find out where
the WIMPs are hid. Just such a lot of things
there's left to do, and physics needs you yet!
