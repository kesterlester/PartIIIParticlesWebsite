<H3>A 20 billion euro collider</h3>
<pre>The particles love the man de Broglie,
Who decreed that to see the world that's small,
More energy is always the right call.
"To solve the world's many puzzles," say we,
"Bigger colliders are all that we need!"
Keep smashing protons with protons or walls,
Someday, we will finally learn it all,
Be it monads or strings or cute fairies.

But with great apparatus, great costs come,
Funds that could feed the hungry, cure the ill,
Fight climate change, build quantum computers!
Luckily, physicists aren't at all dumb;
Ingenious ideas are coming still,
That will sustainably lead us further.
