The Mandelstam variables $s$, $t$ and $u$ for $2\rightarrow 2$ scattering processes are defined as
$s=(p_1+p_2)^2$, $t=(p_1-p_3)^2$ and $u=(p_1-p_4)^2$, where $p_1$ and $p_2$ are incoming four-momenta and $p_3$ and $p_4$ are outgoing four-momenta.  Within this question you may neglect the masses of all incoming and outgoing particles.
\begin{parts}
    \part
    Show that $s$, $t$ and $u$ are not independent by considering $s+t+u$. \marks{2}
    \answer

    \bookwork{One of the example sheet questions required students to show that $$s+t+u=m_1^2+m_2^2+m_3^2+m_4^2,$$ which is a statement that was also made in Lecture 1 and printed on Handout 1, so this question (which asks for less since all masses may be neglected) is bookwork.  One mark for simply stating that $s+t+u=0$ (even if given without proof) and another for giving some clear indication that it follows from momentum conservation .... perhaps by writing $$s+t+u=2 p_1.p_2 -2 p_1.p_3 - 2 p_1.p_4 = 2 p_1.(p_2-p_3-p_4) = 2
    p_1.(-p_1)=-2m_1^2 =0.$$}
    \endanswer
    \part
    Find $s$, $t$ and $u$ in terms of $p$ and $\theta$, where $p$ is the magnitude of the three-momentum of $p_1$ in the centre-of-mass frame, and $\theta$ is the angle between the spatial parts of $p_1$ and $p_3$ in that same frame.\marks{4}

The last two non-zero Feynman diagrams implicitly contain only one spin combination each ($RR\rightarrow RR$ and $RL\rightarrow RL$ respectively) while all others non-zero diagrams implicity average over four incoming spin combinations, in terms of which the outgoing spins are fixed by the rule that the helicity arrows (not drawn) pass through each QED vertex without changing direcection (i.e. one helicity arrow into and one out of each vertex, or vice versa).  The assignments of quantity labels to process labels may be done as follows:
\begin{enumerate}
\item
The three `impossible' processes can be immediately identified by either the lack of a valid lepton flavour conserving Feynman diagram  (\numberbadone:\procbadone\ and \numberbadtwo:\procbadtwo) or lack of helicity conservation (\numberbadthr:\procbadthr). These are all therefore \labbadone\ with a zero matrix element having no releveant dependence on $s$, $t$ or $u$.
\item
There is only one $s$-channel Feynman diagram (\diagannihil\ for \numberannihil:\procannihil), and only one quantity in the list having an $s^2$ in the denominator (\labannihil:\msqannihil).  The wording of the question informs us that every listed quantity corresponds to at least one of the listed processes, so these two must be one and the same. Furthermore, most students should recall that this is the first diagram they computed in lectures.  They saw computed the angular dependence of the numerator (proportional to $(1+\cos\theta)^2 + (1-\cos\theta)^2$) not only using spinors and a sum of modulus squares of Lorentz dot products of electron and muon currents, but also by considering the angular dependence of the initial state.  In the case of the latter, it was noted that thie initial state was either $\left|1,+1\right>$ or $\left|1, -1\right>$ and so either full backward (or respectively full forward) scattering of the electron would be impossible and indicated a $(1\pm\cos\theta)^2$ dependence in the numerator. These recollections can be compared to th values for $t$ and $u$ just found in the earlier part of this question, to reconfirm that the numerator supplied agrees with those facts.
\item
There are four pure $t$-channel Feynam diagrams (\numberemuOS:\procemuOS, \numberemuSS:\procemuSS, \numbereRmuR:\proceRmuR\ and \numbereRmuL:\proceRmuL) and three pure $t$-channel quantities (\labemuOS:\msqemuOS, \labeRmuR:\msqeRmuR\ and \labeRmuL:\msqeRmuL). Given that every listed quantity corresponds to at least one of the listed processes, this means that 
%either: each one of these quantities is used once with one process while a single `other' (\labbadone) is needed for the remaining process, or 
two of these quantities are used once and the other is used twice. On close inspection it should become readily apparent that the two processes with specified initial spins (\numbereRmuR:\proceRmuR\ and \numbereRmuL:\proceRmuL) are just two of the four fixed-helicity initial states that need to be considered when looking at \numberemuSS:\procemuSS.  The first is a mixture of $\left|1,0\right>$ and $\left|0,0\right>$ without any preferred $z$-component of spin, and so must have an isotropic numerator of
which $s^2$ is the only possiblity.  The second is a $\left|1,1\right>$ state which (by helicity conservation in each vertex will prefer to forward scatter (and cannot fully backward scatter), as discussed in the lectures, and so must have a $(1+\cos\theta)^2$ numerator which we have already seen is proportional to $t^2$.  The same would be true for the other two of the four fixed-helicity states not considered.  Therefore it can be seen that \msqeRmuR\ is \proceRmuR, \msqeRmuL\ is \proceRmuL,
and their sum \msqemuSS\ must be \procemuSS.  This leaves \procemuOS.  %Does it need a \labbadone?  No it does not. 
After a little thought it shoud be apparent that the only difference between it and \procemuSS\ is the sign of the muon.  This might matter if we were looking at the Weak interaction which threats the L and R parts of particles and antiparticles differently, but the students have seen in this course that the QED vertex does not treat particles and anti-particles differently. It
is true that the muon to anti-muon change will generate a sign change in the matrix element, but this will disappear when it is squared.  Accordingly we conclude that \procemuOS\ is also \msqemuSS.  This could also be seen, as before, from considering angular momentum only. 
\item
    This only leaves 
\numbermoeller:\procmoeller\ and 
\numberbhabha:\procbhabha\ to be paired with 
\labmoeller:\msqmoeller\ and
\labbhabha:\msqbhabha\ since each must go with one or the other as every `quantity' must be used (so we are told). Here it is easy to tell which is which again from the propagators alone:  Each process has two diagrams.  The former has an $s$- and a $u$-channel diagram, the latter an $s$- and a $t$-channel diagram. Prior to summing over spins, the matrix elements $M_1$ and $M_2$ for each separate diagram will be added to make the total matrix element for $M=M_1+M_2$ for that spin combination, which will
itslef then be squared $|M|^2 = |M_1+M_2|^2 = |M_1|^2 + |M_2|^2 + 2\Re(M_1 M_2^*)$ and then summed over spins. It is clear from these three terms, then, that we should expect a process requireing a mixture of $s$- and $t$-channels to have a matrix element built of a sum of (i) a spin-averaged matrix element squared for the $s$-channel part, (ii) a similar term for the $t$-channel part, and (iii) a third term containing a product of an $s$-channel propagator and a $t$-channel propatator
term (rather than either one on its own squared).
\end{enumerate}
The sketching of the $\cos\theta$ distributions will, for the most part, consist of recalling that $t=-\frac 1 2(1-\cos\theta)s$ and $u=\frac 1 2(1+\cos\theta)s$ which (after squaring and realising that $s$ is effectively a constant) give respectively backward or forward quadratic biasses in $\cos\theta$ to numerators, while $s^2$ terms give isotropic decay. The puropose of these sketches is not to catch students out, but rather to remind them, before they struggle with part (iii), that they
SHOULD be able to predict largely the form of the cos-theta distribution from angular momentum conservation in most cases, and can thereby use this fact to help them answer (iii).  Where there are $t^2$ terms in the denominator, there will inevitably be a divergence in the differential cross section in the forward region, as described in lectures.  The hardest plots to draw will be two that come from crossed diagrams, as these have a cross term and (in one case) both forward and
backward peaks.  Nonetheless, sketching ought to be within the capability of the students given that they dependence of numerator and denominator separately is no worse than quadratic.

\answer

This is a re-hash of 2010 question 2.  Though this paper is among the last 16 years of past tripos papers in this course that are available on the course website, it is one of the three years for which no worked solutions were ever published. Given that it is 7 years old, and a nice question, it seems OK to re-use it without much variation.
\endanswer


\begin{parts}
    \part For the case where the proton is at rest, express $s$, $Q^2$, $x$ and $y$ in terms of the proton mass, $m_p$, the electron scattering angle $\theta$ in the lab frame, and the energies of the incoming and scattered electron, $E_1$ and $E_3$.\marks{4}

    \bookwork{Again this answer is largely bookwork as it involves re-capitulating the content of pages 188 ad 189 of the handout, these being the pages that describe the Quark-Parton model and identify $x$ with the momentum fraction of the struck parton in the infinite momentum frame.  It will be necessary here to neglect the mass of the struck parton in comparison to the energy of the proton, and to regard the struck parton having negligible transverse momentum.}

    The differential cross section for electron-quark scattering can be written as

\frac{\text{d}\sigma^{eq}}{\text{d}Q^2}
=
\frac{4\pi \alpha^2 e_q^2}{Q^4}\left[ { (1-y)+\frac{y^2 } 2}\right]
$$
where $e_q$ is the charge of the quark.  Using the parton model, including contributions from the light quarks $(u, d, s)$ only, show that
$$
\frac{\feptwo(x)}{x} = \frac 4 9 [u(x)+\bar u(x)] + \frac 1 9 [d(x)+\bar d(x) + s(x) + \bar s(x)],

\answer

\bookwork{This is very close to bookwork. The notes make much use of the Callan-Gross relation $F_2(x)=2x F_1(x)$. With that in mind, it is a trivial exercise to spot that the difference btween the doubly differential ep scattering formula given in the rubric of the question differs from that given in this local part by the sum of the relevant pdfs each weighted by the charge of the relevant quark squared -- as expected. The expression for the neutron should be the same as that
of the proton, except that it needs neutron rather than proton structure functions.

wherein the first step we have assumed that $s(s)$ and $\bar s(x)$ are identical for neutron and proton, and wherein the third step we have split the quark PDFs into valence and sea parts 
$u(x)=u_v(x)+u_s(x)$, 
$d(x)=d_v(x)+d_s(x)$ and simultanesouly assumed that the sea $u$ distribution is the same as the $\bar u$ disribution etc, i.e. have replaced $u_s(x)$ with $\bar u(x)$ etc. In the fourth step we assumed isospin symmetry $u\leftrightarrow d^n$, $d\leftrightarrow u^n$ (both for sea and for valence quarks).
In the sixth step we assumed 
two valence up quarks in the proton ($\int_0^1 u_v(x) \text{d}=2$)
and 
two valence down quark in the proton ($\int_0^1 d_v(x) \text{d}=1$).

Since the measured value is significantly less than 1/3, and since the prediction is $1/3$ plus an integral of a difference between the number of sea anti-ups and sea anti-downs, we can interpret this result as telling us that there are more anti-downs in the proton than anti-ups, at least on average (i.e.~when integrated over $x$).  This is likely to mean the same thing for the sea-component of the ups and downs too, since they should be created most frequently by gluon splitting.

   In the parton model for neutrino-nucleon scattering the structure functions are 
   $$
   F_2^{\nu p}(x) = 2x[d(x)+s(x)+\bar u(x)]\qquad\text{and}\qquad F_2^{\nu n}(x)=2x[u(x)+\bar s(x)+\bar d(x)].$$
   Assuming $s(x)=\bar s(x)$, obtain an expression for $x s(x)$ in terms of the structure functions for neutrino- and electron-nucleon scattering,
$F_2^{\nu N}(x) = \frac 1 2(F_2^{\nu p}(x) +F_2^{\nu n}(x))$
and 
$F_2^{e N}(x) = \frac 1 2(F_2^{e p}(x) +F_2^{e n}(x))$.\marks{7}
\answer

\begin{align}
    F_2^{\nu N}(x) &= \frac 1 2(F_2^{\nu p}(x) +F_2^{\nu n}(x)) \\
                   &= \frac 1 2(     
    2x[d(x)+s(x)+\bar u(x)] + 2x[u(x)+\bar s(x)+\bar d(x)] 
    ) \\
                   &=      
    x[d(x)+s(x)+\bar u(x)  +u(x)+\bar s(x)+\bar d(x)] 
    \\
                   &=      
    x[
u(x)+\bar u(x) + 
    d(x)+\bar d(x)] + 
2 x s(x). \qquad\text{(assuming $s(x)=\bar s(x)$))}
\end{align}
\begin{align}
    F_2^{e N}(x) &= \frac 1 2(F_2^{e p}(x) +F_2^{e n}(x)) \\
                 &= 
 \frac 4 9 x[u(x)+\bar u(x)] + \frac 1 9 x[d(x)+\bar d(x) + s(x) + \bar s(x)]  \nonumber
  \\
   &+ 
    \frac 4 9 x[u^n(x)+\bar u^n(x)] + \frac 1 9 x[d^n(x)+\bar d^n(x) + s(x) + \bar s(x)] 
 \\
                 &= 
 \frac 4 9 x[u(x)+\bar u(x)] + \frac 1 9 x[d(x)+\bar d(x) + 2 s(x) ]  \nonumber
  \\
   &+ 
    \frac 4 9 x[d(x)+\bar d(x)] + \frac 1 9 x[u(x)+\bar u(x) + 2 s(x) ] 
 \\
                 &= 
 \frac 5 9 x[u(x)+\bar u(x) + d(x)+\bar d(x)] + \frac 4 9 x s(x)   .
 \end{align}
 where again 
we assumed isospin symmetry $u\leftrightarrow d^n$, $d\leftrightarrow u^n$.
Putting these two results together:
\begin{align}
    \frac 5 9  F_2^{\nu N}(x) -  F_2^{e N}(x) &= \left(\frac {10} 9 - \frac 4 9\right) x s(x) \\
     &= \frac 2 3 x s(x)
\end{align}
and so
\begin{align}
    x s(x) 
    &= \frac 3 2 \left( \frac 5 9  F_2^{\nu N}(x) -  F_2^{e N}(x) \right) 
    \\
    &= \frac 5 6  F_2^{\nu N}(x) -  \frac 3 2 F_2^{e N}(x) .
\end{align}

Provide possible physical explanations for why $\bar d(x)>\bar u(x) > \bar s(x)$.\marks{3}
\answer

The strange quark has by most methods of determination a substantially higher mass than the up or down, and so should be considerably kinematically suppressed in the sea with respect to the other two.  It is harder to say why the sea contribution of the $d$ should be higher than that of the $u$.  One cannot rely again on mass since the up and down are very similar in mass and almost massless relative to the proton (having 0.2\% and 0.5\% of the proton's mass), unlike the strange quark
(which has about 10\% of the proton mass, a significant fraction - given that only half of the momentum of a proton is typically carried by quarks!). In the lecture course
the supplied plot of proton parton distribution functions (with $Q^2= 10 \text{GeV}^2$) indicated the sea $d$-quark contribution was a 20 to 30\% higher than that
of the $u$, noting that this effect was `not understood -- exclusion principle?'.  This would be acceptable as an answer if backed up by some additional explanation.  E.g. ``Whenever a sea $\bar u$ is created by a gluon, there must be an associated $u$. This $u$ would then find itself competing against the valence up quarks in the proton for phase space.  Given that there are already two valence up quarks in the proton but only one valence down quark, sea up quarks (being fermions
and therefore being subject to
 Fermi's exclusion principle) might find it harder than down quarks to 
 find states that are not already occupied by other similar quarks.  This might disfavour $\bar u(x)$ with respect to $\bar d(x)$.''
