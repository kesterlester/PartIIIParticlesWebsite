Professor Brian Cox he had no cause,
To set the laws of physics as they are;
With particles and forces quite bizarre,
And space and time which always come in fours.
 
The fact the universe exists gives pause
So too that James Bond's hand is spin one-half
Or broken symmetry: parity-charge
Which oscillates neutrinos back and forth
 
All the above and more our lect'rer's said
One hundred ninety-seven cm* tall
His consciousness (located in his head)
Throws up some gems but truly, after all
His 'lecture interaction', it is said,
Not correlated to his mass at all.
 
*to be pronounced 'see em'</pre>
