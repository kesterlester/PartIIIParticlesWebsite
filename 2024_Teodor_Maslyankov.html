A Sonnet about Helicity and Chirality
</h3>
<pre>
 
Out of concepts in physics, all so bright,
Helicity and chirality I seek to understand,
Forever intertwined, they come hand in hand,
And our imagination they so easily ignite.
 
Helicity shows, during a particle&apos;s flight,
If the spin is aligned against or toward
Chirality&apos;s way more abstract than that -
It&apos;s about what happens when &gamma;5 and a spinor unite.
 
But oh, when one forgets about mass,
Like the neutrino that is just so fast and light,
Or even a particle that moves with the speed of light,
the two ideas converge as one, alas,
and helicity&apos;s up is chirality&apos; right,
and vice versa- oh what a delight!
