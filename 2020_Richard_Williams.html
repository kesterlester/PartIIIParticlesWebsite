<h2>one strange day</h2>
<h3>Richard Williams<h3>

<pre>
Neutrino in my hand, how can it be?
Is it fine in my woolen mitten?
surely not if it were a kitten.
So I checked on my neutrino flavoured e.

Goodness I cried! I began to waver
you can imagine my shock
for in my mitten, not a sock
A neutrino had changed flavour.

My friend the standard model, in his great juggle
claimed neutrinos had no mass
which made the oscillations quite a puzzle

Neutrino flavours are a fuzzle
a superposition of a different class
neutrino then do shuffle</pre>
