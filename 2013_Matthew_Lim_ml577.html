<pre>Susy’s Swansong

When first Feynman wrote down his QED
The loop corrections to the boson mass
And associated sins of naturalness
Were surely faults that he could not forsee,
Which motivate a supersymmetry
That cancels out the top unpleasantness
Only to introduce an utter mess
Of sparticles, conserved R-parity:

Alas! For though the theorists are keen
(The neutralino’s a dark candidate)
No scrap of evidence has yet been seen
Constraining parameter space of late
This incessant model building might mean
We leave poor Susy to her grisly fate.
