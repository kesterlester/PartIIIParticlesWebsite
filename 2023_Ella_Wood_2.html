<H3>Alice's Adventures in Collider-land</h3>
<pre>
Within lies hidden cryptic beauty cloaked,
In simple stories cast in readers' minds.
Aboard the ship true North the compass finds,
With scenes of jade and opal hills evoked.
In lucid dreams where fantasies are stoked,
Trapped Alice wanders on and there she finds,   
Clear cloudless skies with stars and comets lined,
Her quest complete the opera's scene uncloaked.
 
The harp and cello start, an organ sounds,    
Rare beauty based in miracles hidden deep.
Athena beckons Zeus and hope resounds,
Cascades of silver shine at Hera's feet.
Eased gently awake edelweiss surrounds,
Rich memories which whispered secrets keep.
